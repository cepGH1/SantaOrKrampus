example of a springboot crud app</br>
This repository is the result of a Department for Education Bootcamp run by QA.com in software development</br>
Reason for doing this - learning to carry out a small project in Java</br>
Project was managed agilely, using Jira, Scrum and Kanban boards</br>

<h3>Thoughts about the Project</h3>
Reproducing a SpringBoot crud app was OK. Testing took far longer than I expected. At least a whole day longer. I still have an enormus amount to learn about Jira.
<h4>What delayed me</h4>
After packaging with Maven it was difficult to get the app to wok again in eclipse.
